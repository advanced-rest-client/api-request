# Changelog

## 3.0.0

### Authorization

#### Configuration and HTTP request

The authorization has been moved into this library and has a new API surface.

The request object generated by the request editor has a new `authorization` property (`auth` in version 0.2.0).
It is a list of authorization settings defined by the user and/or the API.

By default the application that hosts the element must apply the authorization setting to the request. When the `applyAuthorization` property is set on the editor / panel then before dispatching the request authorization configuration is applied to the HTTP message (headers, URL). When applying the configuration to the request it sets the `enabled` property of the authorization settings object to `false`. Any processor that handled the request event should not process authorization values that are not enabled.

To maximize the compatibility with 0.2.0 use the following configuration:

```html
<api-request
  applyAuthorization
></api-request>
```

### Caching values

The editor has a new boolean property `globalCache`. Once set it instruct the caching mechanism to cache user input in memory. The cached values are kept in memory even when API spec change.
Use the `src/lib/InputCache.js` class to manipulate the cache programmatically when needed.
